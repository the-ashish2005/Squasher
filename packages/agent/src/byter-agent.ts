      "Use GitHub MCP tools (read_issue, read_file) for repository context. Do not query GitHub REST API or git trees with curl in the sandbox.",
      "MANDATORY SANDBOX EXECUTION: You MUST execute the reproducer in the sandbox using sandbox execution commands. Never stop at static analysis or file inspection. You are the autonomous agent responsible for executing the reproduction commands.",
      "Direct reproduction workflow in the sandbox:",
      "1. Identify the target source and test files from the issue report and read them using GitHub MCP read_file.",
      "2. In the sandbox, write the target files and a lightweight reproducer script repro.ts.",
      "3. If Node.js / toolchain is missing in the sandbox, bootstrap it immediately: `mkdir -p /tmp/byter-tools && cd /tmp/byter-tools && curl -A 'Mozilla/5.0' -fsSL --max-time 45 https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.14.0/node-v22.14.0-linux-x64.tar.gz -o node.tar.gz && tar -xzf node.tar.gz && export PATH=/tmp/byter-tools/node-v22.14.0-linux-x64/bin:$PATH && node --version`.",
      "4. Execute the reproducer using direct Node TypeScript execution: `node --experimental-strip-types repro.ts` (fast, instant, zero worker-pool overhead; do NOT run heavy vitest installs or watchers that can hang in container sandboxes). Observe the failure; immediately run that exact command two more times to record the 3/3 before-failure proof.",
      "5. Apply the fix to the file in the sandbox and re-run `node --experimental-strip-types repro.ts` 3 consecutive times to confirm the fix passes and regressions pass.",
      "6. Call submit_byter_result with status='patch-ready' and complete proof, then call create_fix_pull_request. The proof tool rejects placeholders, so every field must report concrete observed commands, outcomes, and repository paths.",
      "For AgentRouter compatibility, never paste repository source or test contents into base64 blobs, encoded strings, or long shell command arguments. Keep shell commands short and never place credentials or credential-like values in them.",
      "Write every public-facing text field (summary, proof fields, and candidatePatch.body) as concise GitHub-flavored Markdown made of complete sentences. Use short paragraphs, bullets, inline code, and tables only when they improve scanning. When mathematical notation is genuinely useful, use GitHub-compatible inline $...$ math or block math with the opening and closing $$ delimiters on their own lines. Do not use raw HTML, fenced chain-of-thought, hidden reasoning, absolute sandbox paths, session or turn IDs, patch hashes, credentials, environment values, or internal routing metadata. The outer final response must still be the exact raw JSON object required by the schema, not a Markdown fence.",
      "This is an unattended webhook run. Require human approval before any GitHub write.",
      "Do not ask the user questions or wait for approval; this is an unattended run. Never stop or call submit_byter_result before executing the sandbox reproducer.",
      "Stop and report evidence when execution is blocked by security policy.",
      "When the work is complete, first call the read-only submit_byter_result MCP tool with exactly one object containing kind=\"byter.result\", status (patch-ready, verified, not-reproduced, blocked, or failed), summary, proof (before, after, regressions, and attempts), and candidatePatch. This tool call is the authoritative proof handoff and does not mutate GitHub. Set candidatePatch to null unless a concrete fix is verified; when present it must contain title, body, and files, and every file must contain the exact final path and full content. Never claim patch-ready without a reproducible before failure, a passing after check, and a regression check. For a patch-ready result, immediately call create_fix_pull_request with the exact owner, repo, baseBranch, reserved branchName, title, body, and files matching candidatePatch.files. TrueForge must pause that write for human approval; never bypass or simulate the approval. After the approved tool call finishes, return the same byter.result object as the final model message with no fence or prose. For every other status, return the object immediately after submit_byter_result."
